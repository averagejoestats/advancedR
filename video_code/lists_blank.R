# Lists

# Lists are non-atomic vectors. Each element of a list is an R object
# with no restriction that each element must be the same type

# example: dimnames


# The analog to "c" is "list"

# Lists can be named

# names works on lists as well

# lists can contain lists!

# Data frames are a special type of list:
# Each list element is a vector of the same length




# these two attributes treat a data frame as a list


# other attributes

# as.data.frame converts matrix to a data.frame

# column names get transferred

# Tibbles are an alternative data frame with many nice properties



# Columns need not be atomic vectors!
# used by sf package to include points of a polygon in a data frame
