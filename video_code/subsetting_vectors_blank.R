# subsetting atomic vectors, matrices, and arrays

# atomic vectors


# named atomic vectors
# why doesn't the last one work?

# logical subsetting

# which vs logical when vector contains missing values

# matrices
# be vigilant about R's automatic coercion to vectors

# treating matrix as a vector


# multiple-index subsetting

# subset via a matrix of row-column pairs

# see automatic coercion at work. 


# arrays

# these look similar but do different things!

# make sure it's a matrix


# subsetting and assignment
