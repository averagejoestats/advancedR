# Functions
#   how to define and call a function
#   parts of a function
#   calling functions - rules for ordering of multiple arguments
#   variable scoping (this video)


# lexical scoping: determines how R looks up values of objects

# what happens here? times_y uses the x passed to the function (4),
# then it does not see y, so it looks one level up, grabs y(3).

# when a function is defined, it records the environment it was defined in

# when a function is called, it creates a new sub-environment


# things can get complicated when a function returns a function



# see if you can figure out what's going on in f1 and f2
